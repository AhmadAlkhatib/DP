This repo is meant to be used as a base case study for the difference between recursion and dynamic programming by solving The Rod Cutting Problem.

## The Rod Cutting Problem

**Problem description**
Suppose you have wooden or a metal rod that you want to cut into parts with each part being a multiple of a fixed length `a`. i.e. a rod of length `9*a` could be split into 4 parts (note that the parts ar arbitrary) such as in the following case: a,a,3a,4
